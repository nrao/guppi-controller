==================
 GUPPI Controller
==================

This is the software controller for GUPPI, "the best damn pulsar instrument in
the world" (via http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/).  GUPPI started with the name
"Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument", but really we just call it
"guppi" (though it is *ultimate*).
